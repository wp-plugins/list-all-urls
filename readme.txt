Creates a page in the admin panel under Settings > List All URLs that outputs an ordered list of all of the website's published URLs.

== Description ==

This plugin will add a page to the admin panel that displays a numerically ordered list of all published URLs within a website. 

Now, why would such a feature be helpful? 

First off, it allows you to quickly check all of your website URLs to ensure they are using valid characters (i.e no % symbols that may have been entered by copying and pasting from another document). 

Secondly, let's say you're planning on moving your website to a new URL, or perhaps you would like to update many of your website's existing URLs for better SEO or accessibility. This plugin give you a quick and easy way to view all website URLs on one single screen and can serve as a great starting point for creating a list of 301 redirects as part of an .htaccess file. 

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
